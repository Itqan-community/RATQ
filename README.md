# RATQ

RATQ is the developer marketplace at the center of the Itqan ecosystem: a place where developers discover, verify, and integrate Quranic-data resources, including libraries, SDKs, datasets, APIs, and tafsir sources.

Built with a real open-source community behind it - see who's shipped what on the [Contributors page](https://ratq.itqan.dev/contributors).

This repo's `main` branch is a Next.js/TypeScript rebuild in active development, previewable at [beta.ratq.itqan.dev](https://beta.ratq.itqan.dev) and [ratq.itqan.dev](https://ratq.itqan.dev). The product is still pre-launch (see the roadmap). The old static-wiki version of this repo is preserved on the `old_main` branch for reference.
